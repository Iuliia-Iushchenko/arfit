      ADVANTAGES OF THE PROJECT
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The increase of the nutritional value of the starting live feed from the
        cysts of artemia crustacean due to:
        <ul>
          <li>diversity of the indispensable PUFA;</li>
          <li>vitamins А, Е, F;</li>
          <li>microelements.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The therapeutic and prophylactic effect (the key advantage). Increasing
        the immune status of larvae and the young, growing vigorous species of
        all age groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        The drug-premix “ARFIT” – is a 100% natural remedy produced from wild
        plants of domestic origin.
      </li>
      <li>The absence of hormons in the composition.</li>
      <li>
        The use of “ARFIT” to obtain all of the abovementioned effects is more
        economically profitable than the attainment of them by individual drugs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The drug-premix “ARFIT” is provided by the original technology of use –
        the improved bioencapsulation of live feed produced from the cysts of
        artemia crustacea. Due to this technology the bioavailability of the
        immunomodulating biologically active substances for fish and crustacen
        larvae is optimised and thus, the high suvival rate (up to 90%) of the
        individuals at the early and all the subsequent stages of ontogenegis up
        to puberty is achieved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Suitable for the enrichment of dry artificial aquaculture feeds giving
        them therapeutic and prophylactic properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prolonged shelf life – up to 4 years due to the antioxidant in its
        composition.
      </li>
