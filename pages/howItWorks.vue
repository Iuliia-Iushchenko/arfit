    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Therapeutic and prophylactic immunomodulating effect</h3>
        <p>
          The therapeutic-prophylactic drug-enricher of fish feeds “ARFIT” – a
          specially created micronized form of natural substrate with the unique
          composition of biologically active substances among which – organic
          fatty acids, carbohydrates, specific polypeptides, vitamins and
          microelements. The unique composition of the content and optimal
          micronization of natural substrate are the main conditions that ensure
          high bioavailability (digestibility) and unsurpassed efficiency of the
          drug.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mode of action of “ARFIT” –strengthening of the immune protection
          of the cultivated organisms: the activation and maintenance of the
          innate immunity of the larvae and the young of fish and crustaceans
          and ensuring their high viability, increased rates of the growth and
          development due to the unique compatibility of vitamins,
          microelements, polyunsaturated and other fatty acids in the
          composition of the drug.
        </p>
        <p>
          The health effect of “ARFIT” is achieved, firstly, through the action
          of the phytocomplex in its composition, namely, such natural (not
          synthesized) biologically active substances that exhibit
          immunomodulating, antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, antiparasitic
          properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biologically active substances of the phytocomplex in the composition
          of “ARFIT” – are specific polypeptides, bioflavonoids,
          polysaccharides, organic acids, natural antibiotics in the most
          convenient form for digestion. Included in the phytocomplex immune
          activators increase the rate of the maturation of the immunocompetent
          cells: leukocytes (macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils) attacking and
          absorbing pathogens, increase phagocytic (cellular) activity, help to
          destroy foreign cells, give information on the presence of “an alien”
          to the other cells of the immune system, such as macrophages,
          neutrophils and NK cells (killer cells).
        </p>
        <p>
          The health effect of the drug “ARFIT” is achieved, secondly, through
          the action of its consistent biologically active substances of animal
          origin (from the cysts of artemia crustacea) represented by the
          vitamin-lipid complex. More than 70 chemical elements from the
          periodic table; essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega-3 and
          Omega-6), fatty acids, vitamins A, E, F, carotenoids, squalene,
          cholesterol derivatives which play the key role in the processes of
          growth and development of the young of fish and shrimps and
          maintaining high viability of adult species.
        </p>
        <p>
          «ARFIT» is an environmentally friendly product made from plant and
          animal endemics – wild plants of Altai and Western Siberia. It is
          absolutely safe, non-toxic, non-addictive.

        <h3>Improved method of bioencapsulation</h3>
        <p>
          The improved method of bioencapsulation of artemia naupliuses by
          “ARFIT” is used to prepare the enriched live feeds in order to
          increase the survival rate of the aquaculture facilities at the early
          stages of ontogenesis. The technology is known for the increase of the
          nutritional value of artemia crustaceans at the second metanauplial
          stage by means of the bioencapsulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids
          (PUFA) (docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic) with the help of the
          drug «Selco» (manufacturer - company «INVE», Belgium; Sorgeloos P.,
          Lege Ph., 1986). At the same time artemia may be enriched by other
          polyunsaturated acids which are absent in naupliuses as well as by
          vitamins, hormonal drugs, prophylactic and therapeutic agents.

          Technology of the enrichment of starting, production and reproduction
          artificial feeds for feeding fish and crustaceans
        </h3>
        <p>
          The technology of the enrichment of the dry artificial feeds with the
          drug-premix «ARFIT» for the purposes of the increase of linear-weight
          indicators of the cultivated organisms, their caloric content and the
          improvement of the taste qualities as well as to improve the viability
          by means of the prophylactic measures and treatment of the young and
          adults of fish and crustaceans.
